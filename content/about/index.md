Hello, and welcome to my site!


I'm a Statistician and Graduate Research Assistant at the University of Rochester, studying to complete my PhD under Drs. Ashkan Ertefaie and Robert Strawderman.

I have several research interests, mostly focusing on causal inference problems:

* Causal mediation analysis
* Variable selection methods in causal Inference
* Post-selection inference techniques
* Personalized medicine through indivualized treatment strategies
