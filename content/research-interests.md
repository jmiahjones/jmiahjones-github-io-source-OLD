I'm very interested in applications of machine learning techniques to problems with a causal inference component.

Causal mediation analysis allows researchers to understand how causal effects work. My thesis work has included using machine learning ensembles to provide more robust causal mediation analyses. In the process of developing this framework, I've been interested in applying selection techniques to select a set of important mediators. This has further lead to a method for applying inference techniques for the selected model.

I've carried these research interests to personalized and individualized medicine. My recent thesis work involves developing post-selection inference techniques for treatment strategies estimated in a Robust Q-Learning setting. This setting applies some of the machine learning ensembling methods in the Dynamic Treatment Regime problem, and the inferential problems present several interesting philosophical and theoretical problems. More to come!
